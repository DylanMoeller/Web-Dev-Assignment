# Web-Dev-Assignment
Assignment for web development course 


Task 10 -

In this assignment I used a green theme, as Fochabers is a town surrounded by a lot of wooded areas, and woodland activities (walking, cycling ect.) are perhaps one of the key features of the towns tourist side. I opted for a simple banner and quote as I could not find the towns "motto" and added a relatively thick border to highlight the name of the town and reinforce the idea of the woodland theme (as the groove border used is a dark green colour). On the visit bootstrap task, I used a card widget as it takes up the full space of the 5-7 column split used, not sure if this is apparent in the final product, but I felt this would imply the idea that there is a lot of activities available in the town, as the card widget has an imposing impression due to it being a block. Unfortunately, I faced two main challenges in my assignment, one of which, most noticeable was the failure to complete the git section, whilst I understand Git as a whole, I can't make sense as to how you directly link a codio file to a respository and are then able to see all commits. I did see the command that had to be run in the assessment post, but did not understand where or how to run it. My second challenge was images, finding licensed images that I was allowed to use was very challenging and I was unfortunately unable to find an historical photo of the village, I feel like this would have added quite a bit to a relatively mundane section of my website, due to the lack of historical events and images.
